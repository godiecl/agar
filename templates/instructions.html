        <h3>Welcome to the Ambiguity Analysis Experiment</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this experiment is to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of automated ambiguity detection in software requirements. Your active and conscientious participation is vital for the validation and continuous improvement of this tool, ultimately enhancing the clarity and accuracy of software requirements documentation.
        </p>

        <h4>What is Ambiguity?</h4>
        <p>
            Ambiguity within software requirements refers to terms or statements that can be interpreted in multiple, potentially conflicting ways. Such ambiguity can lead to confusion, implementation errors, delays, and increased costs in software development projects. Resolving ambiguity is critical to creating clear, actionable, and reliable requirements, significantly reducing project risks.
        </p>

        <h4>Context of the Experiment:</h4>
        <p>
            Software requirements often contain ambiguous or unclear language, leading to potential misunderstandings or implementation issues. This experiment investigates how effectively automated ambiguity detection complements human judgment in recognizing and clarifying unclear or vague requirements.
        </p>

        <h4>Objectives of the Experiment:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Accurately identify ambiguous elements within software requirements.</li>
            <li>Compare human perceptions of ambiguity against the automated detection system.</li>
            <li>Facilitate the clarification and improvement of ambiguous terms through user-driven corrections.</li>
            <li>Collect detailed user feedback to refine and enhance the systemâ€™s accuracy and usability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Structure of the Experiment:</h4>
        <p>The experiment comprises two clearly defined stages, each accompanied by a help button (ðŸ’¡ Help) that provides additional explanations and guidance at any point during the tasks:</p>

        <h5>Stage 1: Ambiguity Assessment</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>You will sequentially review a set of software requirements individually.</li>
            <li>For each requirement, carefully evaluate its level of ambiguity and select the appropriate category (No Ambiguity, Low, Medium, High).</li>
            <li>Proceed until all requirements are fully evaluated.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Stage 2: Clarification and Improvement</h5>
        <p>
            In this second stage, you will focus on improving the clarity of the software requirements by addressing the ambiguous terms identified by the system. These terms will be automatically <strong>highlighted using different colors</strong> to assist you in locating them easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are expected to review and edit each requirement to resolve potential ambiguities. If a term is ambiguous or unclear, <strong>delete it and replace it with a clearer and more precise alternative</strong>. If you believe the term is appropriate as written, you may leave it unchanged. Once a term is modified or replaced, the highlight will disappear automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> After editing the requirement (even if no changes are made), you must click the <strong>Save</strong> button to store your input. Only after saving will the <strong>Next</strong> button become active, allowing you to proceed to the next requirement. 
            <strong>If you make further changes after saving, you must press Save again before continuing.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If needed, you may also rewrite the entire requirement to ensure full clarity.
        </p>
        

        <h4>Important Instructions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Your responses will be carefully analyzed to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of the ambiguity detection system.</li>
            <li>We kindly request that you approach each requirement evaluation and modification with thoroughness, precision, and the highest possible commitment to quality.</li>
            <li>There is no time constraint for completing the tasks; prioritize accuracy and thoughtful responses above speed.</li>
            <li>Upon completing both stages, please ensure that you download your final results. A confirmation screen with a download link will be provided at the conclusion of the experiment.</li>
        </ul>
